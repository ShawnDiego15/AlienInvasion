# AlienInvasion
Alien Invasion game from the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. This project is outlined in chapters 12, 13 and 14 of the book.

This repository contains the files for a game called Alien Invasion. In Alien Invasion, the player pilots a ship that can move from the left of the screen to the right of the screen. The ship can also shoot bullets that travel up the screen until they hit an alien or reach the top border of the screen.

Aliens appear in a fleet that slowly travels horizontally and downward as time progresses. If an alien is hit by a bullet fired from the ship, the alien is eliminated and their sprite will be removed.

Within this project, a number of files can be found.
- Code files for the game.
- Markdown files containing notes from each chapter.
- Folders for images.

Additional changes may be made to improve this file over time.
