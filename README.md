# AlienInvasion
Alien Invasion game from the Python Crash Course book by Eric Matthes. This project is outlined in chapters 12, 13 and 14 of the book.

This repository contains the files for a game called Alien Invasion. In Alien Invasion, the player pilots a ship that can move from the left of the screen to the right of the screen. The ship can also shoot bullets that travel up the screen until they hit an alien or reach the top border of the screen.

Aliens appear in a fleet that slowly travels horizontally and downward as time progresses. If an alien is hit by a bullet fired from the ship, the alien is eliminated and their sprite will be removed.

Within this project, a number of files can be found.
- Code files for the game.
- Markdown files containing notes from each chapter.
- Folders for images.

This is a work in progress and will continue to be expanded overtime. At the time of writing this file, users can expect the following functionality:
- A ship to appear on the screen.
- Being able to pilot the ship using the left and right arrow keys.
- Fire bullets using the space key.
- Aliens to visualize on the screen, however they will be stationary and will not react to bullets reaching them.
